# Python-Linear_Regression_Abalone_Age_Prediction
We employed two linear regression methods—Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)—to predict the age of abalones based on physical measurements. OLS was implemented from scratch only using NumPy and Pandas, while SGDRegressor utilized Scikit-Learn's built-in libraries. Model performances were evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination. Visualization of actual vs predicted and residual plots was accomplished using the seaborn library. The results indicate a slight superiority of the OLS method over the SGD Regressor.
